dev-lang/python lto-none.conf # supposedly this will build with fat-lto but it didn't work for me
dev-libs/libgcrypt o-flag-munging # lifted this from the official clang profile.  Should let clang build libgcrypt.
dev-libs/openssl lto-none.conf # wget fails to compile if openssl is built with lto
sys-libs/musl lto-none.conf # musl does not currently build with LTO
sys-apps/attr compiler-gcc-fat-lto.conf # not sure exactly why this fails under clang
